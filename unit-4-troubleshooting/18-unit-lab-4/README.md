# Unit 4 Lab: Carefully Adding a Bit More Logic

## Overview
Welcome to the Unit 4 lab!

Our goal is that, at the end of the next lab (you're almost there!), your app makes it possible for users to search for a movie and print out either the Rotten Tomatoes rating or the search results.

Let's get a little closer. We still have hard-coded values, but in the next lab we'll actually get the real ratings. For now, let's incorporate some error-catching.

------------

## Deliverables

You're going to continue building this locally. We've copied over solution code from the previous lab as a starting point for this lab.

## Requirements

1. Your `get_movie_rating` takes a source argument and prints a message if the source isn't found.
1. Your `Movie`'s `rating` holds a list of dictionaries.

## Directions

See the markdown cells within the `starter.ipynb` notebook for directions.
