# Contributing to Python Programming

This course continues to evolve and change, so we always want to hear from instructors about suggestions for improvement, bugs, and any other feedback. As this course is new, we expect a fair amount of feedback.


## Issues

Several labels have been created to report issues:

  - **Typo**: fix yourself and submit a pull request
  - **Broken links**: fix if possible and submit a pull request; flag with this label otherwise
  - **Code bug** : fix if possible and submit a pull request, flag otherwise
  - **Content error**: fix if possible and submit a pull request, flag otherwise
  - **Content missing**
  - **Content request**
  - **Enhancement**: specific feedback for iteration or future iterations

Use the 'Issues' tab to create a new issue and use one of these labels. Please be as explicit as possible. If you're also making a pull request, include the link to your request in the body of your issue.
