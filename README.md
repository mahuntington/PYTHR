# Python Programming

---

> This course introduces beginners to the Python programming language, with a brief working intro to Data Science (Pandas).

## Overview

In this Python Programming course, students will walk away with a solid foundation in Python, able to confidently build basic applications. Students will also get an 8 hour dive into Pandas (for Data Science), and walk away with a project of their choosing they've built using that library.

   (no need to create a presentation, just make sure your .ipynb file has Markdown fields of text)
   
Submissions: you will collect all relevant files for your project into a Google Drive folder and submit the shareable link via Slack DM.

Make sure the cells in your Jupyter notebook have been run before saving so we can see all results without having to re-run.
