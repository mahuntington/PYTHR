# Unit 2 Lab: Control Flow

## Overview
Welcome to the second unit lab!

Right now, you have a variable to hold a movie title, a variable to hold a movie's rating, and a print statement to show the user.

Next, let's set up the functions and control flow to print out the values of our variables.

------------

## Deliverables

You're going to continue building this locally using solutions from the last lab as a rough starting point.

## Directions

Use the `starter.ipynb` file from the lab 2 directory to get started. Follow the prompts in the markdown cells and notify your IA if you have any questions - good luck!
