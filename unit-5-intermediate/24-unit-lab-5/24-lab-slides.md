<h1>Unit 5 Lab: Finalizing the Movie App</h1>

<!--

## Overview
This lesson consists of a hands-on lab during which learners will independently create a working Python program. This lab builds on the previous lab, so starter code (which is the same solution code as the previous lab) is provided for them. You need to introduce the lab, make sure they have working starter code, make sure they can access the lab doc, and be available in case of questions; at the end, go over the solution (located in the `solution-code` folder).


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Apply what they've learned in Unit 5 to create a working Python program.


## Duration
90 minutes

5 MINUTES

**Teaching Tips:**
- Briefly review the high-level learning objectives for Unit 5.
- As you read each bullet aloud, ask students to give you a "fist to five." See **Talking Points** below.
- Observe student votes for each item and make a mental note to follow up with individuals who are not feeling confident, or find time to reteach topics that the majority of the class is uncomfortable with.
- Take time to go over questions (but remember the parking lot).

**Talking Points**:
- Wow, we've covered a lot! Let's take a minute to review what we've learned so far.
- I'm going to read through the topics for Unit 5. As I do so, I want you to tell me how confident you feel that you've mastered each one on a scale of 0 to 5.
  - Hold up your fist to indicate 0 — you don't feel confident at all that you mastered this objective.
  - Hold up all five fingers to indicate 5 — you feel super confident. You're an expert!
