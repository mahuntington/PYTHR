# Unit 5 Lab: Finalizing the Movie App

## Overview

This is the lab we've been working toward. Here, you'll mock up an API call to get the Rotten Tomatoes rating and read in an API key from a file.

------------

## Deliverables

You're going to continue building this locally from the last lab. We've supplied you with starter code which picks up where you left off.

Additionally, you will have a file, `key.json`, with your *own* API key (can be whatever you'd like since this is just a mock-up for now).

## Requirements

- Ability to read in API key from a json file
- Using the requests library to mock an API call

## Directions

Augment the code you wrote from the previous lab, using the supplied starter code. Directions are included in the notebook prompts.
