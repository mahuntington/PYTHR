# Unit 3 Lab: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview
Welcome to the Unit 3 lab!

Our goal is that at the end of the Unit 5 lab, you'll have an app that prints out the Rotten Tomatoes rating for any movie a user enters. We're getting closer!

Right now, let's use object-oriented programming concepts to improve our code. Specifically, we'll be using dictionaries and classes.

------------

## Deliverables

You're going to continue building this locally from where you left off with the last lab, however you'll write all of your code in a new notebook.

## Requirements:

1. You have a `Movie` class.
1. You have a `Media` class.
1. You have docstrings on each function.


## Directions

Please see the starter code notebook included in this repository for directions.
