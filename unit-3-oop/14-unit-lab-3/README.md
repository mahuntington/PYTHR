# Unit 3 Lab: Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview
This lesson consists of a hands-on lab during which learners will independently create a working Python program. This lab builds on the previous lab, so starter code (which is the same solution code as the previous lab) is provided for them. You simply need to introduce the lab, make sure they have working starter code, make sure they can access the lab doc, and be available in case of questions. At the end, go over the solution (located in the solution-code folder).

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Apply what they've learned in Unit 3 to create a working Python program.


## Duration
