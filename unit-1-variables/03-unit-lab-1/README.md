<h1>Unit 1 Lab: Variables</h1>

---

## Overview

Welcome to the first unit lab!

Throughout the course, there is a lab at the end of each unit. Each lab builds upon the prior.

At the end of the Unit 5 lab, you're going to have a mocked application capable of calling an API and returning a result, using object oriented structure.

To get started, let's set up some variables and print out their values.

---

## Deliverables

You're going to build this locally on your computer.

1. A jupyter notebook that defines variables and prints result to `stdout` (an output cell).
1. If you don't already have Jupyter installed, please follow [these instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).


## Directions

Our first goal is just to get the app printing out movie titles and ratings. We'll hard-code in some values for now.

1. Create a variable `movie_title` and set it to `Back to the Future`.
1. Create a variable `movie_ratings` to hold the rating and set it to `8`.
1. Make a `print` statement that says, `The rating for <movie_title> is <movie_rating>`. It should call your new variables, so for example, `The rating for Back to the Future is 8`.
