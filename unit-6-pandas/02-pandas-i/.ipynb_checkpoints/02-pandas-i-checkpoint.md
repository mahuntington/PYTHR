<h1>Pandas I</h1>


<!--

## Overview
This lesson introduces the Pandas library and the beginnings of Exploratory Data Analysis. The majority of the lesson should be spent going through code -- whether that is via Jupyter Slides or a Jupyter Notebook demonstration.

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Use Pandas to read in a dataset.
- Investigate a dataset's integrity.
- Filter, sort, and manipulate DataFrame series.


## Duration
60 minutes

## Suggested Agenda

|    Time     | Activity | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| 0:00 - 0:03 | Welcome |
| 0:03 - 0:15 | Slides |
| 0:15 - 0:17 | NOTE: Switch to Notebook |
| 0:17 - 0:25 | Basic Pandas |
| 0:25 - 0:35 | Columns |
| 0:35 - 0:44 | Filtering and Sorting |
| 0:44 - 0:58 | Independent Exercise |
| 0:58 - 1:00 | Summary |

## Materials and Preparation
- Send out the presentation link.
- Students will need the data sets and notebook. Consider having a zip file of all notebooks and data sets for the rest of the unit that you hand out at the beginning of this lesson. Alternatively, link them directly in GitHub - remember that they haven't learned GitHub, so you'll need to help them download the files.
- The presentation is also at the top of the Notebook, so students can later reference in one place. Jump down to `Importing Pandas`.

## Differentiation and Extensions

- If students are excelling in the first half, consider deeper discussions surrounding five number summaries, data integrity, off-the-cuff filters and sorts
- If students are struggling, work on the code more heavily than the **Class Questions** portions. Make the Independent Exercises be Collective Exercises (as a class)

## In Class: Materials
- Projector
- Internet connection
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python3

## A Note on Delivery

- This unit's lessons will occur in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
  - Slides will be an introduction to the lesson (no code, just overview)
  - Then, we'll open a notebook and start coding!

---

## Learning Objectives
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Use Pandas to read in a dataset.
- Investigate a dataset's integrity.
- Filter, sort, and manipulate DataFrame series.

## So, Pandas the Library


The Swiss Army Knife of data manipulation!

Pandas:

- Is *the* library for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Formats, wrangles, cleans, and prepares our data.

Quick Backstory from 2009:

- A humble open source project for Panel Data (hence "Pandas") from Wes McKinney.
- A 'panel' is the name of the object (in pandas) holding an n-dimensional numpy array
- Don't let the term fool you, a panel is effectively the same thing as an excel workbook (a collection of sheets)
- A 2-dimensional panel is a Dataframe (rows and columns)
- A 1-dimensional panel is a Series (column)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


The process of understanding our dataset and producing our first level of insights.

This includes:

- Reading in data: "Import cat population."
- Checking data types. "Is the population count in integers?"
- Renaming columns: "`cat_breed` is more helpful than `Biological Family`"
- Joining together data: "Join the cat population data with the cat population data."
- Looking for missing data: "It doesn't mention corgis."
- And more!

Today, we will focus on the most 'mission critical' elements of EDA.

## Quick Review

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of understanding our dataset, and producing our first level of insights.What does this include?
- Pandas is a prominent Python library used for exploratory data analysis

## What dataset are we exploring?


- Adventure Works Cycles!

- We will be using a dataset developed by Microsoft for training purposes in SQL server, known the Adventureworks Cycles 2014OLTP Database. 
- It is based on a fictitious company called Adventure Works Cycles (AWC), a multinational manufacturer and seller of bicycles and accessories. 
- The company is based in Bothell, Washington, USA and has regional sales offices in several countries. 
- We will be looking at a single table from this database, the Production.Product table, which outlines some of the products this company sells.


Let's take a closer look at the data dictionary, or what is included:

- ProductID - Primary key for Product records.
- Name - Name of the product.
- ProductNumber - Unique product identification number.
- MakeFlag - 0 = Product is purchased, 1 = Product is manufactured in-house.
- FinishedGoodsFlag - 0 = Product is not a salable item. 1 = Product is salable.
- Color - Product color.
- SafetyStockLevel - Minimum inventory quantity.
- ReorderPoint - Inventory level that triggers a purchase order or work order.
- StandardCost - Standard cost of the product.
- ListPrice - Selling price.
- Size - Product size.
- SizeUnitMeasureCode - Unit of measure for the Size column.
- WeightUnitMeasureCode - Unit of measure for the Weight column.
- DaysToManufacture - Number of days required to manufacture the product.
- ProductLine - R = Road, M = Mountain, T = Touring, S = Standard
- Class - H = High, M = Medium, L = Low
- Style - W = Womens, M = Mens, U = Universal
- ProductSubcategoryID - Product is a member of this product subcategory. Foreign key to ProductSubCategory.ProductSubCategoryID.
- ProductModelID - Product is a member of this product model. Foreign key to ProductModel.ProductModelID.
- SellStartDate - Date the product was available for sale.
- SellEndDate - Date the product was no longer available for sale.
- DiscontinuedDate - Date the product was discontinued.
- rowguid - ROWGUIDCOL number uniquely identifying the record. Used to support a merge replication sample.
- ModifiedDate - Date and time the record was last updated.

## Discussion: What Could We Examine?

- What are some potential insights you'd like to uncover given the data?

- What if you are examining it from the standpoint of a the business?

- What if you are a potential distributor of their products?

---

## Our Modified Adventure Works Dataset


The full dataset is actually a large, star-schema relational databse.

We will work with a modified dataset.

Key changes:

- Only a single table from this database 
- Contains information on products the company makes
    - Such as the product names
    - The product weights, measures
    - And the product prices

---

## Data Integrity


The first thing we check! Assuring our data can be trusted to produce meaningful insights.

Correctly formatted datatypes.

- "Decimals are floats, not strings."

Missing Data

- i.e. "Why do we only have even days of the month?"

---

## Clean Truth about Dirty Data

- Assessing data integrity isn't a one-stop step.

- Much like EDA itself, it's an ongoing process!

- We uncover additional potential problems and anomalies to remedy along the way.
