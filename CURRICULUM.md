# Curriculum Variations: Choose Your Own Adventure

Please find below a few variations on the curriculum created and maintained by our instructors.


## [Taq Karim](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/PYTH2)

**Key Differences**:

* First half of curriculum is much slower and focused on fundamentals
* More small practice problems focused with PSETs after each logical unit (hence slower pace)
* Leverages Google Colab for most of the workflow, including notes, psets, homework submissions.


## [Ali Spittel](https://git.generalassemb.ly/aspittel/python-programming)

**Key Differences**:

* Slower than global curriculum
* Takes out a lot of extraneous/unneeded curriculum
