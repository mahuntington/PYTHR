- For activities or work requiring student input, please create two notebooks: one with sample code and one with blank prompts. Title these `solution` and `starter` code respectively. This way students have a chance to try activities on their own before being given solutions.
- Please refer to our comprehensive [GA Jupyter notebook **style guide** for more guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDTrKLPTNUMC348E9GI--YzSKuNpYcIhY96HGPPHNgo/edit?usp=sharing).
