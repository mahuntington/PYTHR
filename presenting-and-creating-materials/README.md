## GA Data and Tech Curriculum
When creating content for GA's data and tech courses, we use the following formats:

1. **README.md Files**: These are instructor-facing guides that summarize the materials provided for a given lesson or activity.
2. **JUPYTER Notebook Files**: These are interactive workbooks, used to teach, demonstrate, and practice code. Any given lesson or activity topic will have a set of two notebooks: one with solution code and one without. To see how to format Jupyter Notebooks as GA branded slides,
3. **Markdown Slide Files**: These are slides provided for you to present from. Many have embedded code editors (e.g. repl.it), and all have talking points and teaching tips in the comments.

### Options for Presenting On-Brand

There are multiple ways to present slides for your students using preexisting content or GA templates. Each option below has on-brand CSS and styling.

1. [Display Jupyter Notebooks in Slideshow format](./slides-with-notebooks.md)
1. [Serve Markdown Slides Using Reveal.js on Slides.com, Heroku, or locally](./slides-with-reveal.md)
1. [Deliver Markdown Slides using Presentations.ga](./slides-with-presentations.md).
1. [Use Standard Slide Deck Templates (e.g. Powerpoint and Google Slides)](./creating-files.md)
